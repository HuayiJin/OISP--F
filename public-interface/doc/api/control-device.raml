      **Get list of actuations**

      Get list of actuation commands, which was send to the device. By default method returns list of actuations from last 24 hours. There is possibility to get list of actuations from specific period of time, by adding from and to parameters to the url request (see "from and to" paragraph below).

      **from and to**

      * If the `to` key is omitted, data will be retrieved up to the current time.

      * If the `from` key is omitted, from will default to currentTime minus 24 hours. If `from` is positive it will represent the number of milliseconds since Jan-01-1970T00:00:00.000. However, if `from` is negative, it represents the number of seconds to add to `to` (because the number is negative, it will decrease `to`, moving backward in time.

      * There is no way to receive actuations, which were send to device before 24 hours. Only actuations from last 24 hours are stored in application database.

      Here are some examples:

        |from|to|meaning|
        |:--:|:-:|-------|
        | 0 | missing | Return all data available |
        | -86400 | missing | return all data with timestamps in the last 24 hours (86,400 seconds) |
        | 1407979291000 | 1407980711000 | return all observations with timestamps between 2014-08-13T18:21:31.000 UTC and 2014-08-13T18:45:11.000 UTC |
